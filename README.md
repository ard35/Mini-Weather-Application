# Mini-Weather-Application
An app that takes the input of a city and country and returns the temperature through the use of an API. Depending on the temperature, the background will change colors accordingly.

NOTE: A pop-up may appear stating "insecure content blocked". You must click "load unsafe scrips" on that popup. This happens because this app is originally built for web mobile and processes the API request in http, and not https.
